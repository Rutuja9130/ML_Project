Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model for heart disease detection using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features such as age, gender, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other medical parameters.

The project includes the following files:

heart.csv: The preprocessed dataset for training and testing the model
heart_disease_prediction.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: A list of required packages and dependencies for running the project.
The machine learning model is implemented using scikit-learn library and the best performing model is chosen based on various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The final model is then saved for future use and can be used to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not based on their medical parameters.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for solving real-world problems in the healthcare domain. Feel free to fork the repository and use the code for your own projects or to contribute to the project.
